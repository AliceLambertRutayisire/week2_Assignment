Question4 incorporates FittedBox
Question5 incorporates RotatedBox
Question6 incorporates List of flutter Icons
Question7 incorporates Working with Images

To run these files, you will need to install flutter (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and run the codes in either VScode or Android Studio.
make sure you have the right extensions installed too.
